# Self-Navigating-Spaceship
I built a Self Navigating Spaceship Simulation in JavaScript by building a neural network from scratch, also this project uses NO LIBRARIES, just some really cool math and physics

A quick Demo can be found Here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cYqugIbMLVMGOod2L6vpqbE_cz-J4OCu/view?usp=sharing
Also If you want to run it on your own, simply downlod the folder and run the index html file on a live server

Heres what you are seeing the demo:
-Initailly, 400 (or the amount of your choice) spaceships are on a course that is full of asteroids. 
- They are all equiped with Raycasting sensors and "brain" which is a neural network that reacts to obstructions to the rays
- Through a genetic model, each ship is equiped with slightly differented ranges of "reactiveness"
- As they advance through the course, the fittest few survive
- By pressing the save button, I create a bias to those "genes" allowing the children, to still be unique and potentially fitter, but be more simalar to the previous run
- By pressing the delete button I can create a bias try a noticably different approach

  This project was a rollercoaster to build and I learnt so much about javascript and machine learning
